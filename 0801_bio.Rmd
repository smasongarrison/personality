# Welcome to Anatomy and Physiology of Personality

This module is covers Anatomy and Physiology of Personality. Please watch the videos and work your way through the notes. **The videos start on the next page.**  You can find the module playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKrrdtYgOUYZ2BXy4ypzoPdA39mszdnlc). 

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you should be able to achieve all the learning goals outlined below.

*  Understand how psychologists and biologists tried to explain the mind-body problem over the years.
*  Define and relate the parts of the brain to their respective Big Five personality trait and emotional or behavioral outcome.
*  Define and relate neural chemicals (i.e., neurotransmitters and hormones) to their respective Big Five personality trait and emotional or behavioral outcome.
*  Recall the different parts of the neural pathways and how the brainâ€™s chemical impulses (neurotransmitters and hormones) are directed throughout the body.
*  Understand the bidirectional cause-effect relationship between the brain, its neural chemicals, and behavior.
*  Understand the various ways to measure and assess brain activity and function in terms of what they do and why/how they were developed.
*  Recall the specific scientific outcomes for each brain activity measurement and assessment procedure (including psychosurgeries) in terms of the general benefits of each and what we learn from their results.
*  Recall the disadvantages, drawbacks, and critiques of each of the brain activity measurement and assessment procedures (including psychosurgeries).
*  Link parts of the brain with certain neurotransmitters and hormones.
*  Understand the importance of studying the brain in terms of its systems.
*  Apply behavioral outcomes of brain damage to explain the biological basis for personality and emotion.
