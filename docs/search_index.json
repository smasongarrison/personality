This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrisons Introduction to Personality Psychology. This class is a undergraduate-level psychology course at Wake Forest University. I encourage anyone who is personality-curious to work their way through these course notes. The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs. You can find the current version of the course syllabus along with all of the other syllabi for my classes here. All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a [youtube playlist][ds4p-pl-all]. Mason Notes This website is constantly changing. This new course is in active development, and approximately 44.5% done. I have made this process explicitly transparent because I want you to see how you can use R to produce some pretty neat things. Indeed, Ive included the source code for this website in the class github. I encourage you to contribute to the course code. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. If you find cool / useful resources, please add them. By the end of the semester, I would love for everyone to have contributed to the course materials. It can be as simple as adding a course request to the wishlist. I believe that it is useful skill to be able to do. How to use these notes This document is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, youll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester. Every module corresponds to a weeks worth of material. Most modules are dedicated to a specific theme. Within each module, there are embedded videos, slides, activities, labs, and tutorials. The skills developed in each module build upon skills youve developed in previous modules. Eventually, this class will have more modules available than weeks in a semester, so that you  the reader can choose your own adventure (err module) youd like to start with. Although these notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give you all a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes do things outside the notes. The idea here is that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. Status of course In terms of timing, I will have each module completed by the start of the week. The start of the week will be Monday at 12 p.m. EST. It is possible that I will get ahead of this deadline. You can see the current status of the course below. Although you are welcome to work ahead, be aware that I will be making changes to modules that havent officially started yet. In addition, I may add optional materials to previous modules that might be helpful. This table provides the current status of the course. It lists proportions of specific components by module. Overall it is 44.531% complete. "],["attribution.html", "Attribution Major Attributions Additional Attributions", " Attribution This class leans heavily on other peoples materials and ideas.

These tasks are broken down into three stages: explore, engage, and evaluate These stages are designed to be sequential. Complete the explore tasks first. Second, complete the engage tasks. Last, complete the evaluation. For each stage, I will explicitly indicate whether specific tasks are required or merely, recommended. The exploring portion of the class introduces you to the content of the module. It will consist of reading texts and viewing videos. Relative to the other two portions of the module, its more passive. The engagement portion of the class facilitates you engaging with the material, interacting with the other members of the learning community. Students will complete two engagement activities. Most of the time, Ill provide multiple choices for the engagement portion of the module. In order to successfully complete Module 0, please do the following: Explore: Skim: the preface of your textbook (Optional) View: the embedded videos connected to the learning goals.

She earned her PhD and MS in Quantitative Methods from Vanderbilt University, and her AB in Economics &amp; Psychology from Washington University in St. Louis. Her research is an eclectic mix of behavior genetics, individual differences (e.g., personality, intelligence), and statistics.

Get started right here Heres the summary straight from the test makers themselves (source: https://www.sapa-project.org/) \"The SAPA Project is a collaborative research tool for studying patterns of human behavior. Our goal is to find patterns among the vast number of ways that people differ from one another in terms of their thoughts, feelings, interests, abilities, desires, values, and preferences. Personality psychologists have been theorizing about these domains of differences for decades but the data you provide will help us to empirically integrate these domains into a single comprehensive framework. The test on this site will give you feedback about your personality on two levels. First, you will receive scores on the 27 personality dimensions that were identified through statistical analyses of 300,000 SAPA participants. Then we will also give you scores on the so-called Big Five factors of personality plus an overall cognition score. Most people spend 15 to 25 minutes on the full test (you can quit in the middle if you want but the feedback wont be as accurate). The test is entirely free (absolutely no strings attached) and completely anonymous (no cookies, no tracking, nothing). If you enjoy this test, please share it with others. The quality of our research improves with each participant, so were grateful for your involvement!\" "],["welcome-to-personality-methods.html", "4 Welcome to Personality Methods 4.1 Learning Goals 4.2 Module Materials", " 4 Welcome to Personality Methods This module is designed to introduce you to methods of personality research.
