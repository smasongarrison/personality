# Welcome to Personality Methods

This module is designed to introduce you to methods of Personality research. Please watch the videos and work your way through the notes. **The videos start on the next page.**  You can find the module playlist [here][pl-02]. Most of the slides used to make the videos in this module can be found in the [slides repo][slides]. 

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you should be able to achieve all the learning goals outlined below.

* Understand that personality is not directly observable, and data are clues.
* Recognize and classify instances of B, L, I, and S data.
* Define and distinguish B, L, I, and S data.
* Identify strengths and weaknesses of B, L, I, and S data.
* Understand new concepts and terminology associated with different types of data.
* Differentiate the goals of scientific training from technical training.
* Define and distinguish reliability and validity.
* Give examples of techniques researchers can use to improve measurement quality.
* Identify a variety of issues related to generalizability.
* Compare and contrast different types of research designs.
