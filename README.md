# Class Description:

This class provides a survey of theory and research on the structure and function of human personality, with attention to the relationship to cognition, emotion, motivation, and behavior. It requires that you've already taken PSY 151 . In addition, we will discuss other individual differences, such as intelligence.

Broad goals for the course: 

+ The first is for you to understand what personality psychologists think. We will cover classic and current theories, research, and applications of Personality psychology.
+ The second is for you to learn how personality psychologists study their field scientifically. We will discuss the procedures used to test theories and to study issues related to personality.
+ The third is to (hopefully) recognize some relevance of personality psychology for your personal and/or professional life.
